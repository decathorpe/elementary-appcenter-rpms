# elementary-appcenter-rpms

I use this repository to keep track of files related to packaging / building
stable releases of "made for elementary" applications for fedora - either as a
staging ground before they can be imported as official fedora packages, or as
an external repository for applications that won't be accepted as proper fedora
packages (for various reasons) - yet.
